I made a simple project with a very minimilastic front-end 

The project contains 3 folders
1.Img// conatains all the images.
2.Css//contain the css file.
3.Include//contains the common file which is the connection file to the database and also the header file.


In the Main section it contains the 
Index.php
Add_info_script.php
products.php


The Index.php makes only the form where u can add the details of the product and the the add_info_script.php conatains the code of the backend.
The Product.html contains all information from the backend including the details 


On clicking on the Logo it takes back to the home page for the informations to be stored in the database.
Now there is a navigator bar which is used as a link to the next page now cliking the login or sigin it will  move to the next page which contains the informations fetched from the databse in a tabular manner.
